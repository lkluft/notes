# Remote sensing

## Radar
A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the
radio or microwaves domain (1 mm – 1 m, 300 GHz – 300 MHz), a transmitting
antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting
and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the
object(s).

Band | Wavelength | Frequency | Usage
---- | ---------- | --------- | -----
L | 15-30 cm | 1-2 GHz | clear air turbulence studies
S | 8-15 cm | 2-4 GHz | near and far range weather observation
C | 4-8 cm | 4-8 GHz | short range weather observation
X | 2.5-4 cm | 8-12 GHz | very short range weather observation (clouds, snow)
K | 0.75-1.2 cm / 1.7-2.5 cm | 27-40 GHz / 12-18 GHz | similar to the X band
