# Atomic commits
An â€œatomic commit" consists of changes related to one task, one logical unit.

## Atomic Approach
* Commit each fix or task as a separate change
* Only commit when a block of work is complete
* Commit each change separately

## Benefits
* Easy to roll back without affecting other changes
* Easy to make other changes on the fly
* Easy to merge features to other branches
* Supports a structured programming workflow
