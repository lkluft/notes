# Scientific Writing

* **What's new?**
* Find a clear structure
* Define the scientific gap
* Be precise!
* One paragraph, one idea/topic
* Our goal is not to be published, our goal is to be read
* Never reuse old text, especially abstracts
* Use active voice (**S**ubject, **V**erb, **O**bject)
* Find strong subjects for your sentences
* Start sentences and paragraphs from the known and end on the new stuff
* Find a strong ending/statement for a paragraph
* Do not use paranthesis to tell two stories
* Try to avoid "investigate" and "focus", use stronger verbs!
* Verbing nouns weirds language
* Do not use references like "in the previous section", revise structure
* Try to make small but strong claims:
    > ~~Helsinki is one of the most beautiful cities in Scandinavia.~~

    > Helsinki is the most beautiful city in Finland.
* > How would you know you are wrong? - Bjorn Stevens
